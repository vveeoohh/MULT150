1.Is the game too easy or hard? Give 2 unique reasons why it is easy or hard.
I feel like the game is too easy. For some reason hitting an obstacle also increases the time so there's no real stakes.
Even if the obstacles worked properly, they are easy to dodge due to their size and speed. Phasing out isn't a need.

2.What 2 changes would you do to make it easier or harder?
Besides fixing the code for the obstacles, I would make them either longer and/or faster to make it more challenging.
The obstacles also need to be more frequent in order to make phasing out a necessity.

3.List 2 things that would give it a "wow" factor.
The obstacles should be lasers to lean into the "futuristic trash compactor" vibe.
It should also be faster with a soundtrack, to also give it a "Tron" feeling.

4.What 2 parts of the game are fun?
What I find fun is trying to get a highscore and keeping that timer up. Honestly keeping the timer up is more fun than getting a highscore.
There's just that rush of fighting against a number is fun enough.

5.What 2 parts of the game are tedious?
The two that I find tedious are just dodging with no consequences and remembering I can phase out. Like I said before, phasing out isn't necessary and I keep trying to instinctively jump. Instead, I phase out.
I could probably fix the dodging with no consequences. *UPDATE* I did fix the dodging with no consequences but now I get a slowdown when I hit obstacles. Even though that is tedious, it encourages me more not to hit them.

****CHANGES****
So the changes I made was I made both the "Power up" and Obstacles into laser walls. One is blue, the power up, and the other is red, the obstacle. The power up has particles to indicate to pick it up and to give the feeling that
it powers up your phasing out. The obstacle is faster to make it more of a challenge. This unintentionally makes it so the two objects collide and sends one another in a different path (mostly the power up). I was going to fix it,
but it made it more of a challenge when I tried picking up a power up and suddenly it was bumped out of the way by a obstacle.
